HacktoberfestForBeginners was originally created to provide a beginner-friendly environment to participate in Hacktoberfest. While submissions towards this repo [will not officially count towards Hacktoberfest](https://github.com/vichitr/HacktoberfestForBeginners/issues/331), it is a great starting point for learning the process of contributing to open-source!

## Project Structure

This repo is a collection of examples and solutions to common coding problems. For this reason, you will find that files here are often short and focus on one problem. This helps to make contributing simple.

### Algorithms & DS
These two folders contain examples of common algorithms and data structures, respectively. Each folder is further categorized by language. Some examples of algorithms found in the Algorithms folder include Linear Search, Binary Search, Sorting, Sieve, DP algorithms, etc. Some examples of data structures are mentioned in the README of the DS folder. 

### Problem Solutions
The remainder of the repo's folders contain solutions to problems available on learning platforms like Codeforces, Codechef, Hackerrank, Hackerearth, Atcoder, Topcoder, CS Academy, Leetcode, SPOJ, Interviewbit, etc. Each folder name corresponds to its learning platform.
