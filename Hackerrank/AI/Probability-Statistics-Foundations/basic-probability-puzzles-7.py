# Objective 
# In this challenge, we practice calculating probability.

# Task 
# Plant A produces 500 units per day and has a fraction defective output of 0.005.
# Plant B produces 1000 units per day and has a fraction defective output of 0.008.
# Plant C produces 2000 units per day and has a fraction defective output of 0.010.
# At random, a pipe is selected from the dayâ€™s total production and it is found 
# to be defective. What is the probability that it came from plant A?
