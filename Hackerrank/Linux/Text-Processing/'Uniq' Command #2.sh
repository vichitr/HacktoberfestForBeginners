#Given a text file, count the number of times each line repeats itself. Only consider consecutive repetitions. Display the space separated count and line, respectively. There shouldn't be any leading or trailing spaces. Please note that the uniq -c command by itself will generate the output in a different format than the one expected here. 
uniq -c | cut -c7-
